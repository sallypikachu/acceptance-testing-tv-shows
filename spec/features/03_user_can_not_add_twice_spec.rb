# As an organized TV fanatic
# I want to receive an error message if I try to add the same show twice
# So that I don't have duplicate entries

# Acceptance Criteria:
# [] If the title is the same as a show that I've already added, the details are not saved to the csv
# [] If the title is the same as a show that I've already added, I will be shown an error that says "The show has already been added".
# [] If the details of the show are not saved, I will remain on the new form page
